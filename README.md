**Purpose**

The purpose of the website Mental Health Matters is to provide wellness information and links to anyone that is genuinely interested in mental health. Both those worried about someone and someone worried about themselves.

**User Value**

The website provides the user a simple interface that is responsive, easy to navigate and supplies information about mental illness, steps to put yourself in a better state of mind as well as providing links to other resources. There are fake testimonials along with a fake booking form so that a prospective user could arrange for an appointment.

**Features and Deployment**

The specifics of the website are a sticky navigation bar followed by a welcome note and about us section explaining what the website is for. Then there is the opening times and general contact information for the organisation. Wellness information is provided along with general information about mental health and 3 testimonials follow that. Links to other resources sit above the booking and enquiry form which produces a success page with a link back to the main page.

**References**

All information used by the website were inspired by the NHS mental health page and a search for mental health information from google Gemini. 

**Validation**

All features were made from premade bootstrap examples found in the bootstrap documentation and everything was checked for errors in Microsoft Co-Pilot before being validated in W3 Schools HTML and CSS validators.
